### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make our library safer:
- Security researchers will be credited in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- For significant vulnerabilities, we may include recognition in our release notes and README

## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining security for our users. Security updates and patches are provided for supported versions only. Please ensure you're using a supported version to receive critical security fixes.

| Version | Support Status | Security Updates | End of Life |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| >= 1.0.0 | ‚úÖ **Fully Supported** | ‚úÖ Active | N/A |
| 0.x.x | ‚ùå **Not Supported** | ‚ùå None | Deprecated |

### Version Support Policy

- **Latest Major Version**: Full support with security updates, bug fixes, and new features
- **Previous Major Version**: Security updates only for 6 months after new major release
- **Beta/RC Versions**: Not recommended for production use, no security guarantees

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always use the latest stable version in production environments. Pre-release versions should only be used for testing and development.

## Security Best Practices

### TOTP-Specific Security Guidelines

When implementing React Native Nitro TOTP in your applications, follow these critical security practices:

#### üîê Secret Management
- **Secure Storage**: Always store TOTP secrets using secure storage mechanisms (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- **Never Log Secrets**: Ensure secrets are never logged, printed, or exposed in error messages
- **Secret Validation**: Validate secret format and encoding before use
- **Secret Rotation**: Implement secret rotation policies where applicable

#### ‚è∞ Time Synchronization
- **NTP Sync**: Ensure device time is synchronized with NTP servers
- **Time Skew Tolerance**: Configure appropriate time window tolerance (typically 30-90 seconds)
- **Clock Drift Monitoring**: Monitor and handle clock drift in long-running applications

#### üõ°Ô∏è Implementation Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs (secrets, time steps, algorithms) before processing
- **Memory Safety**: Clear sensitive data from memory after use
- **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for TOTP verification attempts

#### üì± Mobile-Specific Considerations
- **Background Protection**: Ensure TOTP codes are not visible in app switcher/screenshots
- **Debug Protection**: Disable debugging features in production builds
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: Consider implementing root/jailbreak detection for sensitive applications
- **Secure Communication**: Use certificate pinning when communicating with backend services

### General Security Practices

#### üîÑ Dependency Management
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable versions of React Native Nitro TOTP and dependencies
- **Audit Dependencies**: Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Use only necessary dependencies to reduce attack surface

#### üåê Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS for all network communications
- **Certificate Validation**: Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **API Security**: Secure your backend APIs with proper authentication and authorization

#### üîí Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored on device
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use strong encryption for data transmission
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary data
- **Secure Deletion**: Properly delete sensitive data when no longer needed

#### üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
- **Secure Defaults**: Use secure configurations by default
- **Regular Security Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Implementation

React Native Nitro TOTP implements industry-standard cryptographic practices:

- **HMAC Algorithms**: Supports HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, and HMAC-SHA512
- **Time-based Generation**: RFC 6238 compliant TOTP implementation
- **Counter-based Generation**: RFC 4226 compliant HOTP implementation
- **Base32 Encoding**: Secure Base32 encoding/decoding for secrets
- **Memory Protection**: Secure memory handling to prevent data leakage

### Security Assumptions

This library assumes:
- The device's secure storage (Keychain/Keystore) is not compromised
- The application using this library implements proper security measures
- The device time is reasonably synchronized
- The secret sharing process (QR codes, manual entry) is conducted securely

## Threat Model

### In Scope
- Cryptographic implementation vulnerabilities
- Secret handling and storage issues
- Time synchronization problems
- Memory leakage of sensitive data
- Input validation bypass
- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope
- Compromised device or operating system
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical device access attacks
- Network-level attacks (unless related to our implementation)
- Third-party service vulnerabilities

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Critical vulnerabilities will be published as GitHub Security Advisories
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes will be highlighted in release notes
- **npm Security Advisories**: Vulnerabilities will be reported to npm for automated scanning

### Update Process
1. **Immediate**: Critical vulnerabilities affecting authentication bypass or secret exposure
2. **Priority**: High-severity vulnerabilities within 7 days
3. **Standard**: Medium/Low severity vulnerabilities in next scheduled release

## Security Testing

We employ multiple security testing approaches:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code analysis for common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Cryptographic Review**: Regular review of cryptographic implementations
- **Manual Testing**: Security-focused manual testing of critical paths

## Compliance and Standards

This library follows:
- **RFC 6238**: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm
- **RFC 4226**: HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm
- **OWASP Mobile Top 10**: Mobile application security best practices
- **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**: Industry-standard vulnerability classification
